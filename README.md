4. Frontida's T5-Small Model Guide

Welcome to the guide on accessing and running Frontida's T5-Small model, designed to support new mothers. This model aids in text generation for various purposes related to maternal health and parenting. Below are the steps to get started with the model through a Jupyter Notebook available in the GitHub repository of Frontida's text generation models.

  Cloning the Model Repository

To begin, clone the repository containing the Jupyter Notebook for the T5-Small model. Follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mama-Frontida/text-generation-models.git model-repo
```

 Accessing the Notebook

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd model-repo
```

 Running the Notebook

Once you have accessed the cloned repository, locate the Jupyter Notebook specific to the T5-Small model. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment and follow the instructions provided within the notebook to run the model and generate text.

 Additional Notes

Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed as per the requirements specified in the repository's README or within the notebook itself. You may need to install specific Python libraries or pretrained model weights to successfully run the model.
